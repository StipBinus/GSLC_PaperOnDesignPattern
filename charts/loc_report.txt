====================================

N=1: Prototype=12, Constructor=20, Diff=-8 (-40,0%)
N=2: Prototype=14, Constructor=33, Diff=-19 (-57,6%)
N=5: Prototype=20, Constructor=72, Diff=-52 (-72,2%)

Conclusion:
Prototype requires slightly more LOC because of registry and clone usage; the overhead grows with number of created objects in the generated samples.
